# TypeScript Definitions

This directory holds TypeScript definition files (`.d.ts`) and type-only `.ts` files that are used throughout the renderer process (`src`) of the IKIAG application. These files provide type safety and improve developer experience by enabling autocompletion and type checking.

## File Descriptions

- `screenshots.ts`: This file contains TypeScript type definitions specifically related to screenshot data structures or objects as they are handled within the renderer process. For example, it might define the structure of a screenshot object that includes its path and preview data.
