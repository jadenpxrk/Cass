# Utility Functions (Renderer Process)

This directory contains general-purpose utility functions and helper modules for the IKIAG application's renderer process (`src`). These functions typically encapsulate common logic or provide convenient abstractions for tasks performed within the frontend.

## File Descriptions

- `platform.ts`: This utility file contains functions related to detecting or interacting with the operating system platform (e.g., macOS, Windows, Linux). It might expose functions to get the current platform or provide platform-specific logic or values that are needed in the renderer process.

- `screenshots.ts`: This file probably contains utility functions specifically for handling screenshot-related operations within the renderer process. This could include functions for preparing screenshot data for display, managing local state related to screenshots (if any, beyond what the main process handles), or other helper functionalities related to the screenshot workflow in the UI.
