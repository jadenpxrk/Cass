# React Components

This directory houses all the React components used in the renderer process of the application. These components are responsible for constructing the user interface (UI) and handling user interactions within the application window.

## File and Directory Descriptions

- `Commands.tsx`: This component is responsible for displaying available commands or shortcuts to the user. It may interact with the Electron main process (via the `electronAPI` exposed in `preload.ts`) to fetch and display this information.

- `icons/`: This subdirectory stores SVG or other image-format icon components used throughout the application's UI. These are typically individual, reusable icon components.

- `shared/`: This subdirectory contains general-purpose, reusable React components that are utilized in multiple parts of the application and do not belong to a more specific category like `ui` or `icons`.

- `ui/`: This subdirectory contains UI components based on the Shadcn UI library. These components are used to build the application's user interface elements.

- `README.md`: This file. It provides an overview of the files and subdirectories within the `src/components` directory and their general responsibilities.

# Page Components

This directory contains React components that represent distinct top-level views or "pages" within the IKIAG application. These components are managed by a routing mechanism or a state machine in `App.tsx` to control what is displayed to the user at different stages of interaction.

- `follow-up/index.tsx`: This component renders the view when the user is in a "follow-up" state. This could be after an initial solution has been provided, and the user wants to provide more screenshots or context to refine the answer or ask further questions. It would handle displaying existing information and allowing new interactions related to the follow-up.

- `initial/index.tsx`: This component represents the initial view of the application when it first starts or is reset. It's responsible for guiding the user to take the first screenshot(s) to define their problem or query. It might display instructions or a an area to manage the initial set of screenshots.

- `main/index.tsx`: This component could serve as a primary container or orchestrator for the different page views. Alternatively, it might represent a core, persistent part of the UI that wraps the other page components. Given the presence of other specific page components, it might handle transitions between `Initial`, `Response`, and `FollowUp` states, or display common UI elements.

- `response/index.tsx`: This component is responsible for displaying the solution or response generated by the AI model after processing the initial set of screenshots. It would present the formatted output (analysis, solution, summary) and potentially offer options to proceed, such as initiating a follow-up.
